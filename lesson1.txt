How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

 It helped me understand how to find bugs in relatively long files

 How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

 It makes us more efficient as we don't have to manually search for bugs and it can be done automatically
